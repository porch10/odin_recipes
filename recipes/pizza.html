    <h2>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

        <p>
            In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h5>Dough:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
                <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>3 3/4 cups bread flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Pizza:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Mozzarella, grated</li>
                <li>Cheese(fontina, parmensan, feta)</li>
                <li>Mushrooms</li>
                <li>Pepporoni</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
                
                After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

                Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. </li>
            <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rise.</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures. </li>
            <li>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.

                Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours). </li>
            <li>Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.

                About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza. </li>
            <li>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.

                Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.
                
                Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches. </li>
            <li>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy. </li> 
            <li>Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal. </li>
            <li>Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese. </li>
        </ol>
